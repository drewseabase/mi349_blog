              <p> My name is Drew Seabase. I am a fifth year undergrad student in Games and Interactive Media. I am also running for the 
              mens Cross Country team here at State. After I graduate I plan to train for the Olympic Trials in the triathlon as well as 
              work for my Masters Degree in Computer Science. What I'm mainly writing about on this blog will be Michigan State Sports updates.

              <h2 id="Now"> Right Now </h2>
              <p> Currently I am working on applying for a Masters Program while also trainign for my final Cross Country Season. My goals for the season 
                is to make the final team for regionals and nationals, as well as place within the top 50 individuals at the Big Ten Cross Country Race. I am
                really excited for Big Tens this year because we are hosting it here in East Lansing at Forest Akers Golf Course on October 31st. It's going to be 
                a really exciting and amazing day and I can't wait for that day to come!
