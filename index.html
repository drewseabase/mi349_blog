        <h2>Spartans Football Week 5 Preview: Will MSU prevail over the Cornhuskers?</h2>

        The Michigan State Spartans will come off of a down week to face a tough Nebraska Cornhuskers team. It’s still early enough in the season to recalibrate some team goals, but late enough to reveal who you really are to other teams. For the Spartans, the checklist is simple: win the line of scrimmage, protect the football, and finish the game playing strong.
      </p>
      <p>
        MSU has been better this season with closing out football games, but Nebraska’s chaos-loving defense might make that hard for Jonathan Smith’s young team. With disguised pressures, blitzes, and defensive talent, the opposing defense will pressure the Spartans offense to adapt and overcome some unique challenges. Setting up a good run game early can help open up receivers later in the game.

        The Michigan State Men’s Cross Country team raced into the history books this past weekend at the Gans Creek Classic, hosted by the University of Missouri. This national-caliber meet featured multiple top-15 programs from across the country, including the nation’s No. 1 team, Iowa State. For those less familiar with college cross country, each race covers 8 kilometers—or about 5 miles—of challenging terrain. With such a stacked and competitive field, every placement mattered, and the Spartans rose to the challenge.

        The team was led by a stellar 8th-place finish from Riley Hough, who clocked an outstanding time of 22:50—a new school record. That translates to an impressive 4:35 per mile pace. Close behind, Moses Osterink, Jack Pennewell, and Thomas Westphal each turned in strong efforts around 23:35 to secure the Spartans’ 2nd through 4th scoring spots. Rounding out the top five, Mike Hegarty delivered a clutch performance to seal the scoring. Thanks to their collective effort, Michigan State earned a 10th-place finish against some of the nation’s top talent—signaling this team’s readiness to contend on the national stage in November.
