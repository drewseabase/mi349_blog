      <h2><b> Spartans Football Week 5 Preview: Will MSU prevail over the Cornhuskers? </b></h2>
      <p style="font-size: 10px;"><b> By: Drew Seabase, September 26th 2025  </b></p>
      <p></p>
      <p style="font-size: 16px;"> 
        The Michigan State Spartans will come off of a down week to face a tough Nebraska Cornhuskers team. 
        It’s still early enough in the season to recalibrate some team goals, but late enough to reveal who 
        you really are to other teams. For the Spartans, the checklist is simple: win the line of scrimmage, 
        protect the football, and finish the game playing strong. MSU has been better this season with closing 
        out football games, but Nebraska’s chaos loving defense might make that hard for Jonathan Smith’s young 
        team. With disguised pressures, blitzes, and defensive talent, the opposing defense will pressure the 
        Spartans offense to adapt and overcome some unique challenges. Setting up a good run game early can help 
        open up our receivers for later on in the game.

      <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        Defensively, Michigan State struggles a little bit. They allow 28.75 yards per game, which places them right around 12th
        amongst all other Big Ten defenses. The Spartans must keep leverage against a talented Nebraska Quarterback 
        in Dylan Raiola, who averages 73.2% completion rate in dropback passes this season against conference teams. 
        First contact can’t be the only contact, the defense must rely on clean and efficient tackles if they want to succeed.
        With great on field leaders like Jordan Hall (LB) and Grady Kelly (DT), the Spartan defense aims to keep their win streak 
        going and have a successful day against the Nebraska Cornhuskers.
