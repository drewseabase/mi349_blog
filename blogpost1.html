    <h2><b> Spartans Football Week 5 Preview: Will MSU prevail over the Cornhuskers? </b></h2>
    <p></p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;"> 
        The Michigan State Spartans will come off of a down week to face a tough Nebraska Cornhuskers team. 
        It’s still early enough in the season to recalibrate some team goals, but late enough to reveal who 
        you really are to other teams. For the Spartans, the checklist is simple: win the line of scrimmage, 
        protect the football, and finish the game playing strong. MSU has been better this season with closing 
        out football games, but Nebraska’s chaos loving defense might make that hard for Jonathan Smith’s young 
        team. With disguised pressures, blitzes, and defensive talent, the opposing defense will pressure the 
        Spartans offense to adapt and overcome some unique challenges. Setting up a good run game early can help 
        open up our receivers for later on in the game.
